Distributions of Shore Storage Manager 

5.0 : Thu Jun 7 15:25 2007
      from starting point being the 4th interim release ...
      1) removed the Imake-based configuration and replaced it with autoconf
      2) changes ssh to smsh

5.0.1: Sat Aug 18 15:37:16 CDT 2007
      1) added the smsh scripts to the distr

5.0.2-prelim: Tue Aug 21 15:04:47 CDT 2007
       1) fixed 'make clean' bug in sthread/tests to get rid of tests/diskrw
       2) fixed 'make clean' bug in smsh to clean up log* and volumes/*
       3) increased volume size in .smshrc to allow all scripts to run
                with default page size
       4) removed logical OIDs
       NOTE-> documents are NOT updated

5.0.2-prelim: Mon Sep  3 16:21:59 MDT 2007
      1) Removed logical IDs.

	 NOTE:
         This will require you to modify your code where
	 some LID-related arguments have disappeared. See especially
	 append_rec and truncate_rec.

      2) Updated documents for removal of LIDs and removed much 
      	ancient and obsolete documentation from the original SHORE
	alpha release.

      3) Added tutorial ssmvas, with hello/ example, suitably modified
         for physical ids. This hello/ builds and runs as part of 'make
	 check'.

5.0.2: Tue Oct  2 12:13:28 MDT 2007
      1) removed more junk assoc with logical ids - in code and in docs
      2) ssmvas, ssmapi are updated to reflect no lids, and to get rid
         of some ancient Shore client/RPC-related stuff
	 Added lid.ssm to man pages.
      3) ssmvas, hello example reorganized, refs to man pages added,
         now a little clearer.
      4) uses standard install prefixes, so now I can 
      		make install
	with configure --prefix=<alt-location>

        BUG: because pdfdir isn't defined in earlier versions of automake,
	     and newer versions don't let me redefine it, I had to avoid 
	     using it.
	     I don't know how to get 'configure --help' not to tell the users
	     about pdfdir, htmldir, etc.

	BUG: might not work with docdir in earlier versions either

      5) top_srcdir gets a file called makeflags when you run 'make'; this
         contains the g++ options (including macro defs, excluding include paths)
	 used in the build.  When you run 'make install' this is put into the
	 $(includedir).  
	 This is really necessary if users are to be able to use
	 installed storage managers.  They need to know what flags were used
	 on the build.

Tue May  6 11:46:38 MDT 2008
      1) tested with aclocal/automake 1.9.6, autoheader/autoconf 2.60
         and gcc 3.4.6
      2) fixed known problems with build targets distclean, install,
	  uninstall, clean
