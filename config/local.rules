CMNT You can override anything in Imake.rules
CMNT by creating a "local.rules" in the directory
CMNT in which you run "make" or in that directory's (')
CMNT parent.
CMNT
CMNT .rules files are for defining Make rules that are
CMNT parsed by Make at the time the file is read.
CMNT The distinction here is necessary because of the fluky
CMNT rules Make has for expanding macros, specifically,
CMNT macros in the target portion of a rule are expanded
CMNT immediately, with the value of the macro at the time the
CMNT rule is parsed.  Macros in the dependency and command 
CMNT parts of rules are expanded on a 2nd pass, and given
CMNT the value at the time the rule is used.
