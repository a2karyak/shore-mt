This file contain support for configuring a SHORE source workspace.

After checking out a workspace perform the following steps in
the shore (top level) directory:

tools/makemake .	// to generate the makefiles
tools/depend		// to make .depend files

Makefile files should never be updated.  Instead, edit the
corresponding Imakefile.  To generate the new Makefile, run
	make make
if the Makefile already exists.
If it does not already exist run:
	DOT/tools/makemake DOT
where DOT is the path to the top level directory.

If you make .depend files you can generate new ones with 
	make depend
Otherwise, use (as decribed above)
	DOT/tools/makemake DOT
