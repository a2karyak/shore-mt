This is a portable version of mount designed to support mounting a Shore
filesystem as an NFS filesystem. 

sh_mount.1 is a manaual page that contains an explanation for
the reason why this program is needed, as well as caveats on its limitations,
vis a vis the "standard" /etc/mount.
(A modified version of this manual page is included in the Shore documentation,
in postscript and HTML forms.)

There are two ways to build this program: in the context of a Shore source tree,
and outside of a Shore source tree.   

In the context of a Shore source tree, use the Makefile generated by Imake.
It will run `configure' on itself. 

Outside the context of a Shore source tree, Imake is not required. Do as follows:

	configure.tmpl
	make

Files:
	README			This file
	configure		A shell script to modify Makefile generated by Imake
	configure.tmpl	A shell script to generate a Makefile from Makefile.tmpl
	Makefile.tmpl	A template edited by configure.tmpl to create Makefile
	smount.1		A man page suitable for use with `man'.
	smount.c		A generic mount program
	sumount.c		The corresponding umount program.

Status:

Currently works on SunOS, Solaris, HPUX, and Ultrix.
Partially ported to Linux.
