This directory contains the documents originally from
the full SHORE distribution. We have selected those that
are pertinent to the storage manager only.

The distribution contains only the PDF forms of these documents,
with the exception of the README.thread_debug, which is in
simple text form.


There is no 'make' target for non-distributions. 
If you are working in your own sandbox at the UW (not with
a release that you downloaded from our website), you
can edit the documents and build them thus:

1) go to the top level directory and run
  makelinks.sh

2) configure --prefix=<somewhere you have permissions to install>

3) make; make check; make install
