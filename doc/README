This release already comes with installed binaries, but if you want to
compile and install your own binaries, follow the instructions below:

	1. use 'startup' to set the right rpc directory.

	2. use 'tools/makemake .' in top directory (~/paradise)
           to build the makefiles.

	3. use 'tools/depend ' to build dependencies.

	4. use 'make' to compile the source code.

	5. use 'make install' to install the binaries.


Refer to the user manual in ~/paradise/doc for information on how to 
run PARADISE, a brief version of the instructions can be found in
~/paradise/installed/bin/README. 

Note:  The default buffer pool size is 16M (16384K) and the buffer
pool sits inside shared memory segment.  Make sure you configure
your shared memory segment size to be larger than 16M (actually
32 M is recommended), otherwise you will have problem starting
the server.

Instruction to run the Paradise client and server in the 
~/paradise/installed/bin directory:

    To start PARADISE server:

	1. copy .pdsrc.tmpl to .pdsrc and edit .pdsrc to set up
	   server configuration parameters.

	   the required parameters are:
	   	sm_logdir: absolute path name for the log directory
	   	sm_logsize: log size in KBytes
	   	sm_bufpoolsize: buffer pool size in KBytes
	   	sm_device: absolute path name for the volume directory
	   	sm_dev_quota: volume size in KBytes

	2. modify pds_init to cleanup the right log directory.

	3. make sure the log directory and the device directory specified
	   in .pdsrc exist, create them if they are not present.

	4. start server by using 'pds_init'.

	5. after the server is shut down (or crashed), you
	   can restart server by 'pds_restart'.

    To start PARADISE front end:

	1. set environment variable PDROOT to  ~/paradise/installed .

	2. use 'pdfe' to start the front end.

	3. refer to user manual for details, on-line help is also
	   available via front end.
