This is an example VAS, called hello, that stores the string
``hello world!'' using the SSM and then prints it.

To do this, the program:
    configures the SSM
    formats a storage device
    creates a volume on the device,
    creates a file on the volume, 
    creates a record, in the file, containing the string ``hello''
    appends ``world!'' to the record
    reads the record and prints it
    shuts down the SSM

The hello program demonstrates how to start the SSM use some of its
basic features to store data.  Compiling and running it is a quick
way to test that your Shore SM installation is correct.

This example program accompanies the document "ssmvas.pdf".

Compiling and Running
