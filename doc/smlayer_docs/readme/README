The SHORE Storage Manager Release 2.0 comprises the lower levels of 
the SHORE (Scalable Heterogeneous Object REpository), a persistent
object system developed at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.
This release contains only the Storage Manager and is not a complete 
release of the SHORE software.

This software is released without support of any kind.

The Storage Manager Version 2.0 distribution consists of 
documentation and source files. 

You can build this software in the following environments 
(and possibly others, but we have tested only these):

UNIX:   You can build on Linux or Solaris using the GNU utilities 
	(with the egcs or gcc compiler).

NT-VS:  You can build on Windows NT using the Visual Studio development 
	environment, with the Visual C++ compiler and linker. 

NT-CYG: You can build on Windows NT using the GNU utilities provided with 
	the Cygwin installation. This uses GNU Make, but compiles and 
	links with the native C++ compiler and linker (distributed with 
	Visual C++).


Requirements 
To install the documentation and source files and build the software, you need:

-- a Sparcstation or Intel X86 processor 
-- UNIX : Solaris (we use SunOS 5.6) or Linux (we use RedHat Linux 2.0.36); 
   with at least 8 MB bytes of shared memory 
   OR 

   Windows NT 4.0 with Cygwin installed (we use Cygwin nt-3.0 20.1) and 
   with Visual C++ 6.0 (and all its service packs) installed.

-- Perl 5 (we use 5.004 04) 
-- You will also need the following, which come with Cygwin on NT and with 
   RedHat Linux:
	- gzip file (de)compression facility to unpack the release. 
	- GNU make. 
	- The Tcl library (version 8.0). 
	- The normal Unix utilities like csh, sh, mv, ar, ld, tar, sed, etc.


-- The following C++ compiler:
	- on Unix, gcc 2.7.2.3 or egcs (we use version 1.0.3) 
	- on NT (regardless of the build environment you use), you must 
	have Visual C++ 6.0 installed to compile and link the storage manager.

-- A PDF reader or printer for reading the documentation. 

-- Lots of free disk space. The disk space requirements are roughly:

	- documents (PDF files): .8 MB 
	- sources alone: 9 MB. 
	- sources, docs, and space to build from scratch:

		= Release version (without debugging symbols and 
		without trace code): (75 MB on NT, 135 MB on X86, 
		165 MB on Sparcstation)

		= Debug version (with debugging symbols and with 
		trace code): (110 MB on NT, 100 MB on X86, 100 MB 
		on Sparcstation)
